## Update for _C.gigas_ Molecular Delivery Project w/ Mac Gavery on August 18th 2022

protocol [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tnhOlAjTnE3xq_jYPnpyv-GLDOd39zkixiHknnmJKyw/edit)

### Experimental Set-up (c. gigas embryos)

Group A: Control, fertilized in 1.5mL tubes, densities of 5,000 cells/mL -> 20,000 cells/mL, no dextran (embryos) 
Group B: Dextran, same densityes as above, all componenets present (embryos) 
Group C: Mac's Control, fertilized in hatchery style, oocytes with dextran, same densities as above (embryos) 

### 1 hours post fertilization

### 24 hours post fertilization (August 19th)

### 48 hours post fertilization (August 20th)
-All densities have swimming larvae, no obvious deformities on average
-I would use a density of ~25,000 to allow for easy viewing under the scope, 5,000 was not dense enough for counts
